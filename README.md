# ☕ Augalassia-CofeShop Management

## 📑 Project Overview
In my university, during my second year in the data structure course, our professor assigned us a project. The challenge was to implement a project using a specific data structure. It seemed daunting at first, but after much effort and perseverance, I finally succeeded! This project turned out to be truly amazing in every aspect. I felt exhilarated when I printed the first bill from my system! Explore all its components; I hope you have an exciting experience discovering them!
